🌐 Web Development Projects

This repository contains beginner and intermediate web development projects that I built while practicing frontend and basic full-stack development concepts.  

The projects are organized by difficulty level and cover HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and small interactive applications. Each project demonstrates practical implementations of responsive design, DOM manipulation, and user interaction.
